        NNTPConnection is a class that wraps and eases the comunication
        to and from an NNTP Server.

        - Usenet Compression supported (GZIP) if the usenet server allows
          for it.

        - SSL Support (you'll ideally want to use the default of TLSv1
          for security reasons; but can support SSLv3 too if the remote
          server can't handle TLSv1).

        - It uses btree+ to store all of it's fetched results using a
          fantastic addon called blist which never maded it into
          python (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3128/)

        - can seek_by_date() using a recusive binary style searching
          which can narrow in great time!

        - all socket i/o parsed through a BytesIO block to
          save on the constent allocation strings would normally
          have caused. Content is then further parsed and broken into
          an easy to parse dictionary (stored in a btree) and
          returned for the user for parsing.

        - any filters specified must be of type NNTPFilterBase. If a
          list or tuple is passed in, then each element in the list
          must be inheritied from NNTPFilterBase.

        secure
        ------
        Secure connection with NNTP Server using a SSL/TLS Encryption

        iostream
        --------
        NewsReap was developed in order to communicate with an NNTP server.
        The idea behind the IOStream is to allow us to handle other protocols
        too. At this time, there are only really 2 values to specify here:
           - NNTPIOStream.RFC3977_GZIP : Support GZIP Compression wrapped
                                          around the standard RFC3977 (NNTP)
                                          protocol.

           - NNTPIOStream.RFC3977      : Standard RFC3977 (NNTP) Protocol

        join_group
        ----------
        Some NNTP Servers have gone out of their way to make sure that all of
        the Message-ID's associated with an article is unique which eliminates
        the need to have to select the group prior to retrieving the article.

        It's obviously slower to do this; so if you're Usenet provider
        doesn't need this option; then don't specify it. It 'will' slow down
        processing if you set this!

        use_body
        --------
        This actually refers to quering the NNTP server for it's articles
        via the BODY command over the ARTICLE.  If this is set to true, only
        the body's content is downloaded.  This is faster; however the trade
        off is using the ARTICLE option hands down the Header information too.

        The Header information is really useful for scanning more details about
        the content we're retrieving.  Sometimes the header information can
        provide us enough information to no bother downloading the rest of the
        content.  Hence having this set to false can actually be faster in
        some cases. By default this is set to False so we can acquire as much
        information on the article we're retrieving as we can dispite the
        small overhead that it comes with.
