    Our Work Tracking object we use to determine who's working and who isn't.

    By keeping it in it's own object, it allows us to wrap communication to
    and from it with a mutex (supporting threading).

    The idea is that we want to consult the tracker to see who's available
    before creating work. If there isn't enough workers available, then we
    spin another worker before assigning the task.

    Without this logic, a new connection to the NNTP Provier is made with
    each request up until the total number of max threads have been met. The
    goal of this is to re-use threads that area already connected before going
    through the painful overhead of creating another connection.
