    An object for maintaining retrieved nzb content. Large files need
    to be split across multiple Articles in order to be posted.

    When combined into one, They create a SegmentedPost

    Similarily; this file makes posting easy by allowing you to add files
    to it in order to prepare an object worthy of posting.

    Every file you wish to post to an NNTP Server should be done through
    this file for the most power/control

        """Initialize NNTP Segmented File

        Args:
            filename (str): Either a path of an existing filename or if
                            you're initializing a new file from scratch this
                            should be the name of the filename being
                            assembled.
        Kwargs:
            subject (str): The subject to associate with the file. This is
                            only required if you're posting the content (to
                            Usenet).
            poster (str): The poster to associate with the file. This is
                           only required if you're posting the content (to
                           Usenet).
            group (str, set): This can be either a string identifying a single
                               Usenet group, or it can be a set() of strings
                               identifying all of the Usenet groups you want
                               to cross-post to. This is only required if you
                               intend on posting the content (to Usenet).
            utc (int, datetime): Should always be in UTC format and can be
                                either defined as the number of seconds from
                                epoch (usually produced from gmtime()) or it
                                can be a datetime() object. This identifies the
                                date to associate with the file.  It's mostly
                                used for sorting.  If no time is specified
                                then it defaults to datetime.utcnow(). If a
                                valid `filename` was specified then the utc
                                defaults to the time associated with the files
                                modification date.
            codecs (CodecBase): The codec to use as our deobsfucation engine
                                You can specify as many Codecs as you want in
                                an interable form.

        be wrapped in {{ }} braces.

        There are some built in directives, but you can alternatively provide
        your own as well.  The built in directives are:

            {{filename}}        : Translates to the filename associated with
                                    the 'first' attachment inside of the
                                    article.

            {{filesize}}        : Translates to the size of the 'first'
                                    attachment inside of the article

            {{filenameXXX}}     : Handles situations where you know there are
                                    multiple attachments and you want to

                                    these entries. XXX is a numeric
                                    represetation starting a 001 and can range
                                    to 999

            {{filesizeXXX}}     : Handles situations where you know there are
                                    multiple attachments and you want to
                                    exclusively index the filesize of one of
                                    these entries. XXX is a numeric
                                    represetation starting a 001 and can range
                                    to 999

            {{totalsize}}       : Translates to the total size of all
                                    accumulated attachments in the article.

            {{index}}           : Translates to NNTPArticles index as
                                    represented inside of the SegmentedPost

            {{count}}           : Translates to total number of NNTPArticles
                                    defined inside of the SegmentedPost

        You can add additionally use your own custom dictionary to which you
        just provide it keys and their translated values.  If you provide any
        custom dictionary, it will always be applied 'before' the built in
        ones.  This allows you to over-ride them if you like.

        All braces are replaced, so in the event braces are detected that
        could not be translated, then they are replaced with 'nothing'

        if strftime is set to True, then the contents of the subject is also
        passed through datetime.strftime() as a last task. this allows custom
        templating to even insert datetime directives if required knowing they
        will be masked shortly thereafter.

        The time strftime() bases itself off is relative to the time specified
        (the actual variable 'relative').  If 'relative' is not specified then
        'now()' is used instead

        The following information was taken from:
                https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html

        It will give you an idea of what datetime objects can be set to. Note
        that datetime.stftime() entries are 'NOT' wrapped in {{ }} objects.
