def get_groups(session, lookup=None, watched=False):
    """
    Returns a dictionary of groups indexed by their names and their value
    set to the database key in the Group table.

     - If watched is set to True, then the watched groups are automatically
       considered in the returned results.

     - If the lookup is an alias, it's looked up and the matched groups are
        returned.
     - If the lookup just matches a group; then that group object is returned.
     - If the lookup is an integer; then the group is looked up and fetched
     - If the lookup is a tuple or list, then all of the entries in the list
       are processed using the above criteria and results merged in the list
       returned.

       None is returned if there was a problem fetching the information.

       A sample response might look like this:
           {
                u'alt.binaries.test': 34,
                u'alt.binaries.another.group': 3234,
