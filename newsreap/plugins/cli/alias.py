        Group Alias Management

        Aliases make it possible to forget about the silly NNTP Group
        naming convention (such as alt.binaries.test) and instead associate
        these names with something easier to remember and manage.

        You can map as many short-formed names as you want to as many
        groups as you want.

        If you map the same name to multiple groups then they will
        both be treated as 1 when you perform actions with them.

    Associate an alias with one or more group names.

    This makes further reference to the group that much easier since you don't
    have to type the entire thing out again.

    For example: one might create an alias of alt.binaries.test to a.b.test

    There are no retrictions as to what the alias has to be, so if you wanted
    to you could just associate them with 1 word (like the above a.b.test
    could have also just been associated with the word 'test' or even 't'.
